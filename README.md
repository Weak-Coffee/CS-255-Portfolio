# CS-255-Portfolio
This REPO is for my coursework for CS-255-R3274 System Analysis and Design
# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well?
The client for this project is DriverPass. They were seeking to build a system that would fill a void in driver education and better prepare people for the driver's test at the DMV. This system will offer online practice exams, host updated DMV rules and regulations, and allow customers to purchase on-the-road driver training packages. 

For this project, I think I was able to effectively design diagrams that illustrate the system with all the components and features DriversPass needed.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the part of this project that I would improve is my UML Use Case Diagram. To improve it I would make it more concise and clear. Use Case Diagrams can easily become confusing when they are trying to illustrate too much information. I think I could better organize my diagram to make it more clear the connections between the Use Cases and the Actors. 
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to consider the user's needs when designing a system because the whole purpose of the system to to serve the user. Without meeting their needs they will see no need to use the system. I used my knowledge and information about the system and the problem it was trying to solve to inform my decisions about how to best interpret the user's needs. Based on the problem you are trying to solve you can insinuate the needs of the user based on what the system offers. 
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing a system from a top-down approach. I always keep in mind the problem the system is trying to solve and the best, most effective way of implementing the system to solve that problem. I think the technique I will use a lot in the future is Iterative Design. Slowly chipping away at a design will often result in the most effective design.
